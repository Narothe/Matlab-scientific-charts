### Purpose of the exercise:
1. To check Ohm's law.
2. To determine the temperature of the filament of the bulb.

## First problem: calculation of resistance

To calculate the resistance you need to use the resistance formula. This formula is given in "additional formulas". Then substitute for the letter "U" the results from the measurements "Ur[V]" and for the letter I the results from the measurements "Ir[mA]". At the very end, we must remember that the results from the measurements of "Ir" are given in "[mA]". This means that we have to multiply the result times 1000 to get the value expressed in "[A]".

The calculations are shown in "CALCULATION OF RESISTANCE." After the calculation, we complete the table.
