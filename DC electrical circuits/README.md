Purpose of the exercise: <br>
1. To check Ohm's law. <br>
2. To determine the temperature of the filament of the bulb. <br>
<br>
Course of the exercise: <br>
1. Assemble a circuit consisting of a resistor, an ammeter (200 mA range) and a voltmeter (20 V range). <br>
2. Vary the voltage U (0 - 6 V) and read the intensity I. Make an accurate note of ΔU and ΔI. <br>
3. Change the resistor to an incandescent bulb and carry out analogous measurements. <br>
4. Read the ambient temperature t0. <br>
<br>
<br>
Testing of the resistor Rt = 100 Ω ± 10 Ω
